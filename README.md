# BuamWave Solutions Retail Store Enhancement Project

BuamWave Solutions is a leading online retail store that has recently acquired a large offline retail business. However, the acquired business is facing significant challenges due to its conventional development and deployment practices, resulting in low availability, scalability, and performance. Moreover, building and maintaining the existing infrastructure is proving to be time-consuming.

## Project Overview

BuamWave Solutions aims to address these challenges by modernizing the acquired business's development and deployment processes. The primary goal is to enhance the overall efficiency, scalability, and performance of the retail stores. Additionally, BuamWave plans to leverage data analytics and prediction to drive growth and improve sales prospects.

## Project Phases

### Phase 1: Servlet Development

In the initial phase, BuamWave will focus on developing servlets to add products and display product details. This involves:

- Creating servlets for adding and displaying product information.
- Implementing necessary dependencies for compiling the servlets.
- Designing an HTML page for adding products.

### Phase 2: DevOps Implementation

BuamWave has chosen to adopt the DevOps model to streamline the development and deployment processes. Key tasks include:

- Using Git for version control to manage all source code.
- Integrating GitHub with Jenkins for continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines.
- Implementing Ansible for automated deployment.
- Utilizing Kubernetes for container orchestration and management.
- Leveraging Docker Hub for image management and distribution between Ansible and Kubernetes.

## Challenges

- **Legacy Infrastructure:** The existing infrastructure follows traditional deployment patterns, leading to inefficiencies and performance bottlenecks.
- **Data Integration:** Integrating data from various storage systems for analytics poses challenges due to disparate formats and sources.
- **Time Constraints:** The urgency to revamp the development and deployment processes requires efficient planning and execution.

## Project Goals

- Enhance availability, scalability, and performance of the retail stores.
- Implement modern development and deployment practices.
- Utilize data analytics for informed decision-making and growth strategies.
- Streamline the development lifecycle through CI/CD automation.
- Ensure seamless deployment and management of containerized applications using Kubernetes.

## Conclusion

The enhancement project undertaken by BuamWave Solutions represents a strategic effort to modernize the acquired retail business and overcome its existing challenges. By adopting DevOps principles and leveraging advanced technologies such as Kubernetes and data analytics, BuamWave aims to transform the business operations and drive sustainable growth in the competitive retail market.
